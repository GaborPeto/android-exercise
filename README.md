# android-exercise
Create a small app to display in a list the posts from here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. When tapping on a post, the post should be displayed in detail in a separate screen, along with all the corresponding comments.   The use of any third-party library is allowed and encouraged.  Please make sure the app works well in both portrait landscape.  We would like to see some clean and testable code, as well as a good coverage by automated tests. Donâ€™t focus too much on UI, it is not the point of this exercise.   Preferred way of submitting the solution is a GIT repository.   Bonus: The app should function offline (offer some type of persistence).
